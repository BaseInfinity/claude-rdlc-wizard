# AI Setup Lanes

Four recommended AI setups for this repo. Setups A, B, and C are complete triads: **planner → driver → reviewer**. Setup D is a lightweight driver-only lane for operational grunt work.

This is **guidance, not a hard rule**. Maintainer override is always allowed.

## Setup A — Sonnet 5 + Fable Advisor (Recommended)

| Role | Model | Effort |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Advisor** | Fable 5 (via `advisorModel: "fable"`) | `high` (server-side) |
| **Driver** | Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`) | `high` default, `/effort xhigh` for hard tasks |
| **Reviewer** | Codex (GPT-5.6 Sol) xhigh | — |
| **Escalation** | Opus 4.8 xhigh or Fable 5 review | When stuck or high-stakes |

The new standard for research work. Sonnet 5 beats Opus 4.6 on every coding benchmark (SWE-bench Verified 85.2% vs 80.8%, Terminal-Bench 80.4% vs 65.4%) while using ~5x less Max quota per turn. Fable 5 advises automatically at key decision points (source evaluation, confidence calibration, methodology design, blast-radius) via native `advisorModel` (v2.1.170+). GPT-5.6 Sol xhigh reviews cross-family — catches blind spots Claude can't see in its own work. Escalate to Opus 4.8 xhigh or a Fable 5 review for the hardest methodology decisions — don't run Opus as the daily driver (burns Max limits 2-3x faster).

**Effort escalation ladder:** Start at `high` (Sonnet 5's default and sweet spot). Raise to `xhigh` for hard source-conflict resolution, multi-document evidence synthesis, or long agent runs. `max` is rarely worth it — doubles cost for marginal gains per CodeRabbit testing.

**Requires:** Claude Code v2.1.197+ (Sonnet 5 alias resolution), Fable 5 access for advisor.

## Setup B — Opus 4.6 Stability (Legacy Flagship)

| Role | Model | Effort |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Advisor** | Fable 5 (via `advisorModel: "fable"`) | `high` (server-side) |
| **Driver** | Opus 4.6 (`claude-opus-4-6`) | `max` |
| **Reviewer** | Codex (GPT-5.6 Sol) xhigh | — |

The consistency-first lane. Opus 4.6 is the only model where `max` effort works without overthinking — months of field data, Active through at least Feb 2027, proven predictable. Lower benchmark scores than Sonnet 5 but higher consistency. Choose this when you've tuned prompts to Opus 4.6 behavior and reliability matters more than peak capability.

**Effort:** Opus 4.6 at `max` (no xhigh support — only low/medium/high/max). This is the sweet spot; community reports confirm 4.6 is the only Opus where `max` doesn't over-engineer.

## Setup C — OpusPlan Hybrid (Saver)

| Role | Model | Effort |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Planner** | Opus 4.8 (via Plan Mode — Shift+Tab) | `xhigh` |
| **Advisor** | Fable 5 or Opus 4.8 (via `advisorModel`) | — |
| **Driver** | Sonnet 5 (auto execute mode) | `high` |
| **Reviewer** | Codex (GPT-5.6 Sol) xhigh | — |

Cost-efficient hybrid using CC's native `opusplan` alias. Opus 4.8 reasons during Plan Mode, Sonnet 5 executes. Max-bundled — no API credit drain. Pin `model: "opusplan"` + `advisorModel: "fable"` in project settings. Sonnet 5 now uses 1M context natively (no `[1m]` suffix needed). GPT-5.6 Sol xhigh is the cross-model reviewer.

**Note:** Opus 4.6 cannot advise Sonnet 5 (rejected in the advisor pairing table). Use Fable 5 or Opus 4.8 as advisor for this lane.

## Setup D — Research Lite

| Role | Model | Effort | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Planner** | You (the user) | — | Task is pre-planned, no model reasoning needed |
| **Driver** | Sonnet 5 | `medium` | Max-bundled, ≈ Sonnet 4.6 at high quality |
| **Reviewer** | None | — | Blast radius too low for cross-model overhead |

The "just do the thing" lane. No RDLC gates, no cross-model review, no planning phase. You already know what to do — you just need a fast, cheap pair of hands.

## When to Use Setup A

The default choice for most RDLC work — full discipline (confidence gates, cross-model review) at a fraction of Setup B's quota cost:

- Primary research drafting (evidence dossiers, investigation reports)
- Confidence-critical work (source hierarchy decisions, claim verification)
- Cross-referencing multiple sources
- Audience-firewall-sensitive deliverables
- Documentation and examples
- Tests
- Normal CLI changes
- Mechanical refactors
- Anything where you'd reach for Setup B out of habit rather than a specific need for Opus 4.6's proven consistency

## When to Use Setup B

Reach for Setup B when the change can damage a consumer repo, has high blast radius, or you've specifically tuned your workflow to Opus 4.6's behavior:

- Methodology design or methodology changes
- Hook behavior changes (affects every consumer research repo)
- Template changes (propagate downstream)
- Installer behavior (`cli/`, `init`, `setup-wizard`)
- Security-sensitive behavior
- Tagged release prep
- Anything where source accuracy or downstream impact matters

## When to Use Setup C

Setup C is sufficient for routine work where a Sonnet driver can ship with a strong reviewer and you want the Max-bundled cost profile of `opusplan`:

- Routine drafting of pre-researched content
- Formatting and structuring existing research
- Documentation
- Examples
- Tests
- Normal CLI changes (non-installer)
- Low-risk methodology edits
- Mechanical refactors

## When to Use Setup D

Setup D is for work where RDLC discipline overhead exceeds the value:

- Data formatting scripts
- Bibliography management
- File moves, renames, bulk operations
- Template generation (non-structural)
- Config updates, env var changes
- Repo maintenance (dependency bumps, lockfile refreshes)
- Anything where blast radius is low and you need speed, not depth

**Not Lite — escalate to A or B:** changes to hooks (enforce research quality on consumers), changes to confidence vocabulary or source hierarchy, template structural changes, anything security-sensitive. If you're unsure, it's not Lite.

## What Setup D explicitly skips

- No RDLC gates (no confidence calibration for running a formatting script)
- No cross-model review (not worth the cost or time for grunt work)
- No planning phase (you are the planner)
- No effort escalation (Sonnet `medium` is plenty)

**The discipline of knowing when NOT to use discipline.** Documenting this lane tells users "here's when to switch off the heavy methodology" rather than silently tempting them to skip it. If the task turns out to be harder than expected, escalate to Setup A or B.

## Final Review Policy

**Setups A, B, and C end at GPT-5.6 Sol xhigh as the cross-model reviewer.** Claude can't grade its own homework — the reviewer always belongs to a different lab with different blind spots.

**Setup D has no reviewer** — the blast radius doesn't justify it. If you're unsure whether a task is truly Lite, it probably isn't. Escalate.

If GPT-5.6 Sol isn't available on your OpenAI account, Codex auto-falls back to Terra — still keep `model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"`. Lower reasoning misses subtle bugs that the reviewer is the last gate to catch.

**Escalation for unusually risky PRs:** `xhigh` is the evidence-based default — OpenAI's own migration guidance is to preserve the prior effort baseline, and no published data shows `max` or Pro mode catching meaningfully more real bugs than `xhigh` on ordinary PR review. For a PR you'd genuinely lose sleep over (security-sensitive, high blast radius, touches the installer or a consumer-facing template), escalate the reviewer to `max` or Pro mode — a once-per-PR gate is exactly the kind of low-frequency, high-stakes call site where the extra cost is easiest to justify. Don't make it the default.

## Version Requirement

`advisorModel` in settings.json requires **Claude Code v2.1.170+**. Check your version with `claude --version`. If below v2.1.170, update from inside a CC session:

```
! claude update
```

The `!` prefix runs shell commands inside your CC session — no need to exit and re-enter. After updating, restart the session for the advisor to activate.

Fable 5 as advisor also requires Fable 5 access for your organization/plan. Fable's inclusion in subscriptions has run in separate windows rather than continuously — free through June 22, 2026, then a second window July 1-7, 2026 (up to 50% of weekly usage limits), then usage-credit metered. Check [anthropic.com/claude/fable](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/fable) for current status rather than assuming either window is still open.

## When the Advisor Is Unavailable

If the advisor returns "Advisor unavailable," the server-side harness failed to initialize. No in-session action (`/model`, `/clear`) can recover it.

**Step 1 — restart the session.** Exit and run `claude` (not `--resume`). A fresh process re-initializes the server handshake. This resolves most advisor failures.

**Step 2 — if the API incident persists:**

- Continue with your driver model and no advisor — `/model sonnet` for Setup A, `/model claude-opus-4-6` for Setup B. Interactive — stays on your Max subscription.
- Or proceed without the advisor and let the Codex xhigh PR gate catch issues.

**Last resort (scripted/CI only):**

- `claude --model fable --effort high -p "$(cat <file>)"` — headless mode bills API credits, not your Max subscription.

Check [status.claude.com](https://status.claude.com) if the advisor fails across multiple fresh sessions.

Whichever path you use, the cross-model PR review gate still applies.

## Credit-Spend Warning

**Setup B (Opus 4.6 max as both planner and driver) burns the 5-hour cap faster than Setup A** — Opus 4.6 max driving implementation is the expensive path; Sonnet 5 uses roughly 5x less quota per turn for comparable benchmark results. If you're hitting the cap mid-session on Setup B:

- Drop to Setup A (Sonnet 5) for the remainder of the day — same discipline, far less quota burn
- Or drop to Setup D for grunt work that doesn't need deep reasoning
- Or use Sonnet directly for the final mechanical edits, then run the GPT-5.6 Sol reviewer over the whole diff at the end

**Setup D uses Sonnet** — same model as Setup A's driver, Max-bundled. One less model to manage if you're already on Setup A.

The reviewer (GPT-5.6 Sol xhigh) is billed against your OpenAI account, separately. Watch both bills.

## Autocompact Thresholds

For recommended `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` values per context window and task shape, see [RDLC.md → Autocompact Tuning](RDLC.md#autocompact-tuning). Sonnet 5 (Setup A, D) has its own native ~967K-token proactive-compaction default at 1M context — don't carry over Opus-era 1M threshold guidance unexamined.

## How Billing Works — 1M Context, Max Plan, and the June 15 Split

A common question: **"does the `[1m]` model alias get billed differently? Does it pull from my Max plan or from API credits?"**

The short answer: **Setup A (Sonnet 5, native 1M) and Setup C (opusplan, Opus plan-mode + Sonnet execute) are both fully Max-bundled in interactive sessions. Setup B (Opus 4.6 max) is also Max-bundled, including its 1M context.** Here's the detail.

### 1M context is free on Max — no API premium

[Anthropic 2026-03-13](https://claude.com/blog/1m-context-ga): 1M context is GA at standard $5/$25 per million tokens for Opus 4.6 (also 4.7, 4.8). No long-context multiplier. **No beta header required**, requests over 200K tokens just work. Sonnet 5 always runs at 1M natively (see [`code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config#sonnet-5-context-window`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config#sonnet-5-context-window)) — no `[1m]` suffix, no separate billing tier.

For Claude Code on Max / Team / Enterprise plans, **1M context is included automatically** with no extra usage allocation for supported models. Whether you set `claude-opus-4-6` or `claude-opus-4-6[1m]` doesn't change *what* you're billed — both pull from the same per-token budget on your subscription. The `[1m]` suffix just makes the alias explicit so it sticks across alias-resolution changes; functionally Opus 4.6 in Claude Code today *is* the 1M-context model on a Max plan.

(Pro plan is the exception: Pro users need "Enable usage credits" turned on in their Claude account settings to use 1M context. Max / Team / Enterprise have it on by default.)

### The June 15, 2026 billing split

[Anthropic moved a slice of usage off the subscription](https://codersera.com/blog/anthropic-june-2026-billing-change-claude-code/) onto a separate metered credit pool that bills at full API rates:

| Surface | Billing as of June 15, 2026 |
|---|---|
| **Interactive Claude Code in terminal** (you typing into Claude Code right now) | **Stays on Max subscription** — unchanged |
| Claude.ai web / desktop / mobile chat | Stays on Max subscription |
| Claude Cowork | Stays on Max subscription |
| `claude -p` (headless / `--print`) | **Moves to separate credit pool**, billed at API rates |
| Claude Agent SDK | Moves to separate credit pool |
| Claude Code GitHub Actions | Moves to separate credit pool |
| Third-party apps via Agent SDK | Moves to separate credit pool |

Credit allocations: Pro $20/mo, Max 5x $100/mo, Max 20x $200/mo. **No rollover.**

### What this means for the lanes

- **Setup A — Sonnet 5 + Fable advisor:** Sonnet 5's native 1M context — interactive session, Max-bundled, no `[1m]` suffix needed. Fable 5 advisor via `advisorModel: "fable"` — also Max-bundled. GPT-5.6 Sol xhigh reviewer on ChatGPT subscription. Roughly 5x less Max quota consumed per turn than Setup B.
- **Setup B — Opus 4.6 Stability:** Opus 4.6 max driver on Max, 1M context included at standard rates (see above). Fable 5 advisor, Max-bundled. GPT-5.6 Sol xhigh reviewer, separate.
- **Setup C — OpusPlan Hybrid:** **fully Max-bundled.** `opusplan` uses Opus (plan mode) + Sonnet (execute mode), both at their native context windows — no credit drain.
  - **⚠️ Avoid `sonnet[1m]` as a manual pin outside Setup A/C:** if your provider or gateway doesn't resolve Sonnet 5 to its native 1M automatically, forcing a `[1m]`-suffixed pin on an older Sonnet can draw from your usage credits pool ($3/$15 per Mtok) instead of your Max subscription. The `/model` picker shows this explicitly — watch for "Draws from usage credits."
- **Reviewer (GPT-5.6 Sol xhigh) in all three triads:** billed against your OpenAI account, completely separate from Anthropic.
- **CI loops that use `claude -p` post-June-15:** these now bill against the separate Anthropic credit pool, not your Max subscription. Consumer-repo CI integrations may need to budget the new credit pool.

### Bottom line

If you're using Claude Code interactively (you, in your terminal, doing research work), **all three full-discipline lanes ride your existing Max subscription**, and 1M context (whether Sonnet 5's native window or an explicit `[1m]` alias) doesn't add extra charges on Max/Team/Enterprise. The June 15 split only affects programmatic / headless / CI use of Claude Code.

Watch the headless surface if you've automated `claude -p` calls in your project — those now bill differently as of June 15, 2026.

## Maintainer Override

**Override at any time.** A blanket setup choice doesn't replace judgment per change. If you're touching a hook but the change is a one-line typo, Setup C is fine. If you're touching templates but the section is the wizard's safety-critical confidence vocabulary, Setup A or B is the call.

The wizard does not enforce setup lane selection — it documents the recommended default per change shape. Whatever ships is your call.
